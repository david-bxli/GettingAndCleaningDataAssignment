Type
		Train or Test
		The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 
		
		
Note:
		The result measurement value in each variable is result of mean of each activity and subject. And the original of train dataset is X_train.txt file under UCI HAR Dateset/train folder, as well as, original of test dataset X_test.txt locates under UCI HAR Dateset/test
		The activity associated with measurement for train data set is from UCI HAR Dateset/train/y_train.txt
		The activity associated with measurement for test data set is from UCI HAR Dateset/test/y_test.txt
		The mapping between train set measurement and subject is from UCI HAR Dateset/train/subject_train.txt
		The mapping between test set measurement and subject is from UCI HAR Dateset/test/subject_test.txt
		The activity description/id indicator is from UCI HAR Dateset/activity_labels.txt
